# 3D Scans
Repository of things I've scanned while playing around with an Xbox Kinect

### miata/
Full-scale scan of my former 2014 Mazda MX-5 Miata (NC.2 facelift) I took while trying to design an aftermarket hard top for it. Scanned some time around 2017/2018.
- `Miata_Mesh.mlp` is a Meshlab file merging multiple scans from the `raw_scans` directory
- `Merged_Mesh.ply` is ... I don't remember. Maybe an export generated from the Meshlab file?
